## Passing Arguments to Functions

1. Rename the function **myFunction** so that it has a sensible name. Don't forget to rename it where it is called.

2. Call the function with the arguments 'Daffy' and 'Duck'.

3. Ask the user to seperately input a first and last name. Store their inputs in two variables. Now call the function with the variables as the arguments.
